# Leetcode

This exists just because it is a nicer experience to use an IDE or similar to solve Leetcode problems, rather than having to use the website. VSCode and other tools are just much easier to work in. The test suite provided is nowhere near as extensive as the one that is run by leetcode, and is not guranteed to cover all the cases. You should validate your solution in leetcode directly and not rely 100% on the test cases provided.
